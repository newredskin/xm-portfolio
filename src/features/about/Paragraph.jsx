      This transition marks an exciting phase where I aim to enrich my skillset
      with the latest in innovative technology and efficient tools. My
      aspiration is to merge the realms of traditional design with advanced
      technologies such as web development, machine learning and artificial
      intelligence. By doing so, my goal is to develop applications/systems that
      not only resonate with designers but also appeal to a broader user base,
      effectively combining timeless design aesthetics with the power of modern
      technology.
