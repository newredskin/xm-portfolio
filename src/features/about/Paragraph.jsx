      This transition marks a phase where I aim to enrich my skillset with the
      latest innovative technology and efficient tools. My aspiration is to
      merge traditional design principles with advanced technologies like web
      development, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. By doing so,
      my goal is to develop applications that not only resonate with designers
      but also appeal to a broader user base, effectively combining timeless
      design aesthetics with the power of modern technology.
